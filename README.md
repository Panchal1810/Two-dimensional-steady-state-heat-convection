# Two-dimensional-steady-state-heat-convection
The study aims to solve the two-dimensional steady heat convection over the simple rectangular domain with Length (L) and height (H) using Finite Volume Method. The problem is solved using C++ language and worked on non-uniform grid (gird data and velocity field is imported from the file).

boundary condition of the domain. The boundary conditions of the domain can be modified using APPLY_BC function.
